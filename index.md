# <font size = "4">Hey there!</font>

I am a PhD student at the [ALPACAS research group](https://amir.goharshady.com/alpacas-research-group) at HKUST, where I am happy to have Amir Goharshady as my advisor. I am broadly interested in algorithms, formal verification, and programming languages. My current research focuses on using parameterized algorithms to efficiently solve problems in program analysis and model checking.

My research is funded by the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme.
